# üíº Cryptocurrency Wallets

### What Is a Crypto Wallet?

It is your bank account in the crypto-verse and can bring many useful features and capabilities buying and selling various cryptocurrencies.

In other words, a crypto wallet is a tool that allows you to **interact** with a blockchain network.

Most crypto wallet providers are software-based, which makes their use more convenient than hardware wallets.

However, hardware wallets tend to be **the most secure alternative**.

### [#](https://dripcommunity.wiki/how-to/crypto-wallets/intro/#how-do-cryptocurrency-wallets-work)How do cryptocurrency wallets work?

Contrary to popular belief, crypto wallets **do not store** cryptocurrencies.

Crypto wallets generate the information necessary to **send and receive** digital assets via blockchain transactions. These transactions are carried out through the use of **public** and **private** keys.

Public keys are used to generate wallet addresses, that you can share with others when you want to receive cryptocurrencies. Such an address is essentially a specific "location" on the blockchain where coins can be sent to.

The private key or seed phrase is like your **password** and is used to create digital signatures and verify transactions.

Simply put, a seed phrase is the ‚Äúmaster key‚Äù for all of your crypto accounts ‚Äì it is your private keys in mnemonic form.

**The private key/seed phrase must be kept secret.**
