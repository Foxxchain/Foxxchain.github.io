# üê∑ Yield Farming



## ANIMAL FARM

Animal Farm is the first deflationary, fully decentralized ownership yield farm/lending protocol in [**DeFi**](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi), where participants earn as owners of the network. It has many **unique mechanics**.

The super wealthy do not build and protect their wealth by selling their assets. They accumulate their wealth and then leverage it while **living off the dividends**.

Animal Farm embraces this financial power and places it in the hands of the platform participants.

All of our products utilize trusted models that allow users to take full responsibility for their personal finances. Animal Farm's main focus is on lending and yield aggregation.
