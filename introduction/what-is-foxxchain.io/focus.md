The main difference between the two is that traditional finance is centralized and controlled by a small group of institutions, while [DeFi is decentralized](../../research-and-development/foxxchain.wiki/decentralized-finance.md) and controlled by a network of users. This can lead to a more open, transparent, and inclusive financial system

we recognize the potential of [blockchain technology](../../research-and-development/foxxchain.wiki/blockchain.md#blockchain-101-blockchain-for-beginners) to revolutionize industries and redefine the way we engage with financial systems.
