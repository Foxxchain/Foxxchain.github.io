## <mark style="color:blue;">**Be Your Own Bank**</mark>

> Imagine a world where you can send money directly to someone without a bank – in seconds instead of days, and you don’t pay exorbitant bank fees.
>
> Or one where you store money in an online wallet, preferably a Cold Storage,not tied to a bank, meaning _**you are your own bank**_ and have complete control over your money. You don’t need a bank’s permission to access or move it, and never have to worry about a third party taking it away, or a government’s economic policy manipulating it.
>
> This is not a world of the future; it is a world that an avid but growing number of early adopters live in right now. And these are just a few of the important blockchain technology use cases that are transforming the way we trust and exchange value. We’ll get into the rest later on.
